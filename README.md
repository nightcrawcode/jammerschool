A way to access block websites on school computers

# what is it?

I found a way to get in block websites in school.
The school will know how you did it but won't be able to see what websites you vist.

# how to set it up

You would need a phone with a hotstop plan on your phone carriers plan
and the computer you will be using! :)

**NOTE: YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS ALL WEBSITES**

step one in or pocket or locker turn on the hotsport from your phone and remeber the network name
and password

step two
on the computer log in to the network that you setup from your phone

and enjoy going on twiiter in school

like i menton [here](https://github.com/nightcrawcode/jammerschool/edit/main/README.md#how-to-set-it-up) they will be able to see how you did it
but won't see what you will do on the network!


I hope this helps you and have fun
